Update 22.04.20 --> Abaqus Code uploaded and will get tested one more time, raw data being uploaded

Link to paper --> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-022-05233-z

Attention:
Unfortunately for Fig. 5. the Figure showing the MAPE instead of the Standard Deviation was put in the paper, therefore it is added here as Updated_Fig_5-Standard_deviation.gif
